accounts-templates-bootstrap
============================

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for twitter Bootstrap

This package depends on [accounts-templates-core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](http://accounts-templates.meteor.com) or have a look at a [live demo application](http://accounts-templates-bootstrap.meteor.com) or at the full [documentation](https://github.com/useraccounts/core).


## Bring Your Own Bootstrap

Adding this package with `mrt add useraccounts:bootstrap` does not add any other packages providing Bootstrap. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!

At the moment it is up to date with Bootstrap 3.3.0.
